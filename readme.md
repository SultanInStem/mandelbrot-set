# Mandelbrot Set Visualization


## Introduction 
The Mandelbrot set is one of the most famous fractals in mathematics, defined in the complex plane. It is generated by iterating the function:

```bash
f(z) = z^2 + c 
```
where z and c are complex numbers. The set consists of all points c for which remains the sequence remains bounded.
